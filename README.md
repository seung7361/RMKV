## Introduction

The RMKV model integrates memory kernels into recurrent neural networks to model the long-term historical information in sequences. This repository provides a straightforward and customizable PyTorch implementation of RMKV, designed with usability in mind for integration with existing projects or use in standalone applications.

## Installation

This project requires Python 3.x and PyTorch 1.x.

1. Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/seung7361/RMKV
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
```
cd RMKV
```

3. Install the required packages:
```
./requirements.sh
```

## Usage
Before using the model, make sure that your data is properly preprocessed and compatible with the RMKV model requirements.

To use the RMKV model in your own project, simply import it and then initialize an instance:
```
from RMKV import RMKV

model = RMKV(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
```
